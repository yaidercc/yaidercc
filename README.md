ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yaider.

I'm a junior web developer, passionate about technology, I constantly seek to convert my ideas and/or needs into programming projects 
and learn new things to improve the quality of my developments.
Although I am currently doing web development, I have also developed applications. desktop and console applications.
